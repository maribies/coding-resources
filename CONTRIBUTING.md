# CONTRIBUTING

I have strong opinions that I try to hold loosely and enjoy hearing from others. If you would like to share resources and/or experiences, I ask that you create a pull request that can be added to this page. I prefer to keep the README at this time to my own endorsements and explorations, but as I explore others', I would also share and give credit/kudos.

I reserve the right to edit/change at any time for any reason (but hopefully will not need to do so.)

Thank you.
